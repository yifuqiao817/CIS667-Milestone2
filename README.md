# CIS667-Milestone2
Yifu Qiao, yqiao08, Syracuse University

Just need to run yqiao08_Milestone2.py to start playing. 

I also did some changes in yqiao08_Milestone1.py so please do not use the previous version linked from milestone1 pdf file. 

When the game starts, you can choose which side you will play, problem size, which AI (tree or baseline) as your opponent. 

When you choose tree AI as your opponent, it will print out the number of nodes the AI will process in this Minimax algorithm. 

You can also call AI_match() to watch tree-based AI vs baseline AI in each problem size (it may takes longer time), then print out a bar gram that illustrate the results.
